# NBA Player Embiidings
This project contains the backing code and data for my project at #######. For background and commentary on the project, please refer to the website.   

Not all data is contained in this folder due to size limitations within Github. Most of the data near the end of the pipeline has been preserved due to its filtered nature. Early phases of the pipeline such as the original data has been deleted due to Github limitations. The original shot and PlayerVU tracking data that is an input to this project can be found in either my fork of the original data (#######) or the original Github repo by Neil #### (#####).
